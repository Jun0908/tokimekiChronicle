            "I wonder how much Reddit influence campaigns / manipulation has been upstreamed and enshrined across different LLMs. Thereâ€™s a very specific worldview that is absorbed as part of training",

            "On a side note, the guy who runs SCOTUSBlog and has argued 40 cases there was caught up in a tax scandal. He did heads-up poker matches where he had a team of pros study the other player's playing style. So it was a bit of an Inception-style mental assault. He was up $50 mil on these games.",

            "Which protocol has the best docs? Want to learn from the best",
            "Going to say the quiet part out loud. Incentives work and Solana as a whole had no incentive to discourage massively-extractive FOMO-driven PND schemes. Priority fees make up the vast majority of chain revenue and these fees were only sustainable as long as the narrative of get rich quick NOW worked. You needed new launches continuously because the volume crush in the launch was the only way to sustain high TPS levels. Validators and the industrial MEV complex have benefitted enormously from these schemes while maintaining a veneer of legitimacy. Theyâ€™re basically the car dealership in Miami that kept selling Bentleys to drug dealers.",

Iâ€™m writing up technical docs this week. Letâ€™s chat if youâ€™re one working on one of the following:\n\n- DefAI agents\n- 4626 Vaults\n- DeFi super-apps\n- Any front-end that wants lending functionality",
            "There is now a non-zero possibility that a sitting president will lose his job as a result of being associated with a memecoin grift",

            "Whatâ€™s the closest equivalent to evm.storage now that itâ€™s gone? Need it for Base Sepolia.",
            "What was the proximity of Bengay to your toothpaste?",
            "Operation Warp Speed could've been marketed as a rousing success and the privacy-preserving contact tracing methods could've helped us manage future outbreaks better (the current flu is pretty bad from what I'm hearing). We spent all that money and actually got the thing and then just decided to throw it all away",

            "exactly, this happens like six times a night to the the chronic thinker (generally every attempted cycle) \n\nthat’s why it would be so OP for the solution oriented mind",
            "the easy way to tell if someone is an insomniac is whether they say it came to them last night or it came to them in a dream \n\ninsomniacs rarely dream; this is exactly why they need to screengrab lol… nothing is being ”stored”\n\nso while the sleeper will have a nice dream that they can largely recall upon waking \n\nthe insomniac will chaotically cycle through a thousand more thoughts before morning, almost all of which will never be recalled again as they never even made it into “local storage”",
            "if you have insomnia you understand that it doesn’t mean you’re not sleeping, because you are categorically sleeping \n\nyou’re just not entering stage three or rem—but you are cycling\n\nas in, you are tapping into those deeper levels for brief moments—fractions of seconds at times—before you’re immediately & inevitably shocked out\n\npeople without insomnia can cycle out naturally—that’s the difference \n\nso if you’re obsessively thinking on a problem as you enter those stages, you’re often hit with deep insights right after you’re shocked out, as your brain started to compartmentalize, which it does through forming connections\n\n(and no, there is no writing it down; outside of the fact that it happens almost instantaneously, you’re generally pushed back into phase 1 & if you intend on getting any sleep that night, turning on a light or reaching for your phone will destroy any chances you have at restoration) \n\n(also yes i’m aware i’ll likely get alzheimer’s; no need to bring it up)",
            "i’m looking forward to the day when i can screengrab my thoughts—likely the same day neurodivergent insomniacs can rise (to some extent they already have)\n\nespecially as ai breaks down skill & experience-based barriers & minds capable of raw creativity are sold to the highest bidder\n\nit will become very hard to compete with the obsessive sleepless minds once they can self-organize at night—the time at which they’re forming connections & developing the best ideas—most of which is forgotten by the morning",

            "let me hold a piece of the network AND a piece of the art (if i like the art)\n\nif i just want to support creators, let me capitalize the network, reduce my risk & earn from network growth alongside the creators\n\nif i like the art (which will just be speculative signaling until attention is, if ever, organically driven to the network), let me move downstream & buy a “piece of the art”(which likely needs a minimum & cap to be meaningful in anyway)\n\nie. is it better to own 0.001% of the art or 0.0001% of the network all the art sits on? \n\nwhich is better for the artist? what about the artist who receives no signal & thus no distribution? is it better that they get paid in network tokens which have reduced volatility & higher chance of appreciation, perhaps funding their next project? or is better to have your 5 current pieces owned by 60 people, making you $30 in your first week, $15 in the next, and now just a few bucks here & there? \n\nwhich is better for holders & collectors?\n\n🤷‍♂️",

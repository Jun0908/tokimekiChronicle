To talk onchain finance, fundraising, captable! \n\nLet’s connect here or on Telegram: @Joris_DLN",

Adding appointments, tracking activities 🙅‍♂️ it’s a nightmare. \nThen I found action.new & I’m hooked. Can’t wait for voice support so I can just say, \"Gymnastics makeup session, 6 PM next Friday. Add to family calendar.\"",

Excited to see this finally happening (we were asking for it to Emmanuele when he was still at CB.\nHappy to test if you still need.\n\nAlso all our customers will enjoy such an offer when ready to receive USDC from their investors!",

            "Founders Friday shoutout 🚀\n\n@fairmint, Fridays aren’t just Fridays. They are FuckYeah sessions where anyone can grab the mic & hype up a teammate who’s crushing it.\n\nSo today, I’m grabbing the mic for a special shoutout to all the builders, casters, dreamers, \nthe ones I’ve worked with, debated with, and learned from over the years.\n\n👉 Keep building\n\nIf you’re still standing, still fighting, still obsessed, you’re unstoppable🔥\n\nTo the builders 💪 ( & a special one to my mate @thibauld )",
            "The why? Simple. Private markets are broken.\nToo many intermediaries. Too much friction. Too little transparency.\n\nThat’s the why.\n\nBringing equity onchain fixes this: efficiency, programmability, interoperability.\nA better system for securities, built on native onchain rails.",

            "👋 I could have titled this cast \"Hello world\"\n\nI’ve been building in the background for years. Now, I feel the need to step up\nSince moving to the US, I stayed behind the scenes, talking to 100s of founders & iterating. I thought a great product/vision & solid fundamentals would naturally reach the right people.\nBut building in the shadows isn’t enough. If you don’t shape the narrative, someone else will.\n\nWe've seen ICOs, DAOs, NFTs, memecoins. Hype comes & goes, but private markets remain outdated\nBut we kept delivering and \n✅ helped founders raise from thousands of investors\n✅ onboarded them all onchain, seamlessly\n✅ turned $1B+ of cap tables into smart contracts on @base \nAll while navigating a US system that resists change.\n\nAfter 1000s of zoom with founders, it’s time to bring those discussions out in the open. \nSo expect more. More insights. More real talk & cast.\n\nBecause tech alone isn’t enough. Execution alone isn’t enough.\nThe why & how matters as much as the code.\n\nOnwards🚀",
            "I’ve told you before, stop feeding the pigeons! 🤣",
            "One of the most frustrating things about Farcaster right now is the new channels feature. \n\nIt’s frustrating when a channel that should be 'community-owned' ends up being locked down by an 'owner' (often early FID but ...) who limits it to just 10 or 50 members able to post. \nIf a channel is meant to serve the broader community, it shouldn’t be locked or controlled by a single owner. Would love to see more flexibility and openness in how these channels are managed.",

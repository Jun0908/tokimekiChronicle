            "Token launches are broken. Liquidity bootstrapping faces high capital requirements & mispricing risks, causing arbitrage losses or stalled trading. Static bonding curves & MEV manipulation make price discovery fragile, while transitioning tokens to AMMs is complex & often leads to value loss. Malicious ERC20s & fragmented interfaces only worsen trust & efficiency. Doppler, a non-custodial Uniswap v4 hook, solves these issues. Dutch-auction bonding curves enable secure price discovery, automated architecture simplifies token creation & liquidity provisioning, & standardized ERC20s ensure security. Doppler creates a scalable, efficient ecosystem for liquidity bootstrapping",

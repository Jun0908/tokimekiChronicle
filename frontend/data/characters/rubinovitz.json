I think people will be willing to give a portion of their secondary if it pops off to public goods/Nouns.\n\nI think the new approach vs staying on the old contracts is the best way to do that for distribution and secondary market efficiency reasons.\n\nBut the Zora SDK won’t be updated until next week so plan is to implement it when it comes out and hard launch on DUNA day March 12 with a way for people to cast and contribute to Nouns and lining up some awesome Nounish mints with splits.",

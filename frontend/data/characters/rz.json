            "One angle on this that‚Äôs actually interesting is Cosmos, which never took on Ethereum‚Äôs research focus or Solana‚Äôs strategy focus, but instead had a technical fundamentals focus (paired with economic autarky)\n\nFirst call with ICF we talked about IBC as TCP/IP, and it was actually credible",
            "Also this",
            "I think about this all the time",
            "No one place in particular, but seems people feel like their voices aren't being heard, in Eth, in the US, etc\n\nPublic figures that used to participate in good faith discourse are being replaced by people like Nikita Bier who are knowledgeable but also make numbers go up",

I cant take this anymore, I have over invested, by a lot. I pay $10 a month for this shit. it is what it is. but I need an AI PET NOW. can @woj.eth DO SOMETHING",
            "Congrats!!",
            "Not sure, but probably just the default feeds",
            "Something that I notice while using @warpcast and @recaster-fc is that the Warpcast feed is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (longer posts, more polished) but the Recaster feed is more personal - more organic, raw, more early stage alpha."

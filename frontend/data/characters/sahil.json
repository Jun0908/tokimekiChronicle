Merkle's been adding whatever functionality/API we've requested for channels so far. my guess is once we find PMF, we should have a good idea of what/how to enshrine on protocol.",

The most active and engaged crypto communities aren‚Äôt necessarily those with the most sophisticated governance models‚Äîthey‚Äôre the ones that have created an identity people resonate with. Memecoins work because they tap into an emotional layer of belonging, humor, and shared experience.\"",

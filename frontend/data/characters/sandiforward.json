            "They are superb!",

            "Looks excellent.",
            "Nice @gramajo.eth let me know if you need help finding an artist",
            "The /ethdenver collection looking glorious and still loading up. üíü\n\n/green-pill /coinbase /mantle and /bankless drops are a few of my favourite designs right now..\n\nhttps://collections.poap.xyz/collections/ethdenver-2025/8106",
            "Meeting the /ethos / /dgen1 team on route to Denver @markus @nc. Vibes are high! \nhttps://moments.poap.xyz/moments/475e7dff-7983-4878-b653-26d16bbb329b",
            "Sure I think subscribe and save a lot of people do and fwiw I think it's great. I use it for these and the range and trust in delivery.",
            "Discovery is horrible. The value prop now sits solely in the flywheel of availability and service (time to deliver). If you want to find and trust something without brand intent already but just item it's just sponsor list after sponsor list.",
            "....now Amazon has a ad rev / total rev % of around 10%. \n\nLet that sink in for a way to destroy the user experience of the platform for profit. \n\nAmazon has done so well but ^ this is the thing that is the start of them losing market share today or tomorrow.",

            "See you there @icetoad.eth",
            "Love seeing user feedback like this from @icedcool üíü. The Duke fintech class attendance use case is excellent üìã\n\nhttps://x.com/icedcool_eth/status/1893715375990174139?s=46&t=t4JMqL9MibrRhBB605xaLA",

            "üëã I'll be sharing this /poap at /ethdenver as proof of meeting. \n‚ö†Ô∏è There maybe benefits from a smile to a beer or even POAP merch for asking for it. \n\nP.S pretty pumped, as this is my first personal drop minting on /base\nhttps://poap.gallery/drops/183370",
            "Excellent tool. Only used on mobile so far and such a smooth experience for tracking keyword/brand mentions on the platform. \n\nSide ask: @pfista if you can create a ‚Äòbookmark‚Äô within /buoy so I can go through list and make a ‚Äòto-respond/review‚Äô it would reduce my clicks and steps",

            "@samuellhuber.eth like native creation? We did have this but saw it abused. Scarcity then lost without adding a downstream ‚Äòblue check‚Äô to split genuine from fake ones. Would like to bring it back if we can solve this.",
            "Good chat. @pauline-unik we literally have some top tier universities marking class attendance with POAPs it‚Äôs a great tool for this."

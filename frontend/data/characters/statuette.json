            "Based Community Building 102 🔵\n\nAt @base we embrace Radical Kindness in our direct community communications, especially in the times of conflict.\n\n(Radical Kindness may mean different things to different people, but this is a specific method I’ve developed over the years—drawing from years of community work, studies in mental health first aid, parenting, and some FBI hostage negotiation methods!)\n\ncontinued below...",
            "Most people resort to aggression due to a fundamental human need to be heard, seen, and validated—which is often amplified by the lack of face-to-face interaction on social media. Here’s how we approach aggression with Radical Kindness in our online communities:\n\n🔵 Step 1: Start the conversation with a respectful compliment and highlight something positive. This disrupts their emotional state and creates a cognitive shift, makes them more receptive to dialogue.\n\n🔵 Step 2: Acknowledge their concerns by mirroring—repeating their sentiments back to them. This step should never be skipped. This helps them feel heard, understood, and validated.\n\n🔵Step 3: Present your counter argument. At that point, even if they disagree, the aggression fades, and they engage in a more respectful conversation.\n\nJust remember: @base is for EVERYONE. Everyone deserves to be heard and respected, even if they are behind an avatar on social media.",

            "We had, when he first released his mirror table blog post in 2021. A lot has changed since then on our end. As you say, we're now a lot closer to his original vision, so we should definitely catch-up @balajis.eth !",
            "Absolutely!! Traveling today but will react / answer 🔥\n\nPS: looking at the other replies, it seems that spam accounts are still alive and kicking 😅 cc @v",
            "Dan, seriously, let's do a community fundraising round... I think a lot of people would want to invest to support you guys and be part of the adventure. I am just in love with the team you're gathering and I am so bullish on what you guys are building (on how you're building it!). You could reserve it to the farcaster builders or any group you decide, you could cap the investment amount (to leave room for everybody)... we made it so easy to do this with Fairmint, and it would not create any overhead for you. \"Community Investors\" could be stripped from their governance rights (0 impact on governance for you) to only give them \"financial rights\". You could make it the investment opened on a continuous basis but only reserved for builders building cool stuff on Farcaster... your imagination is the limit here :)\n\nHMU *whenever* you want, literally, even if it's just to have a complete exploratory casual chat / brainstorm about it!",
            "Onchain equity 🔥\nThe time has come!",
            "yup",
            "I just found this in the printer and it blew my mind... \n\nMy 8 years old did it and it seemed 100% natural to him to mention that his presentation's \"knowledge\" didn't come from him but from \"Chatgipity\" (you know, the competitor of \"Dipsick\" 🥲).\n\nThe concept of \"cheating\" never crossed his mind, on the contrary, he is totally fine disclosing that the knowledge didn't come from him. \n\nWhat a time to be alive! I don't know what the future holds... but it's going be very interesting!",
            "ah! Missed that. thanks!",
            "Question @v @dwr.eth : Did you guys \"purge\" some spam accounts or something lately? Last I checked (around last week), I had ~11K followers and today I am abruptly down to ~8.1K followers 👀 \n\nOr, most likely, the owner of a bunch of spam accounts decided to unfollow me... My casts are not worth the attention of his 3K spam bots 😅",
            "How to know if your 7 years old has been using your laptop?\nThere will be signs 🙄",
            "lol",
            "Soon 7 and 9. They don't ask for it really because we made it very clear that it's only on Saturday and Sunday morning (if nothing else is planned) so they just make sure they enjoy it during this time :)",
            "That's how it's done 😂",
            "Age of Empires and Civilization are *by far* their favorite games",
            "Saturday morning is video game time ☺️ \nNo need to beg them to take their breakfast and get dressed on that day!",

            "Tell me Wall Street doesnt' understand @coinbase without telling me they don't understand Coinbase...",
            "Very cool! What is that setup though? A custom made NES? :)",
            "The creator of Docker is at it again with Dagger!\nEven though it started as a CI/CD framework, it looks like it has a bright future in agent containerization 👀 \n\nThe video is worth watching, it's pretty cool!\nhttps://x.com/solomonstre/status/1891205257516003344",
            "Big fan of @privy 's docs!",
            "Agreed! I am very worried about the US foreign policy at the moment. Building trust takes years of efforts but losing it takes minutes.\nI am afraid we are in those minutes... \n\nI really don't think it's a smart move for the US long term.\nTime will tell...",
            "",
            "I really hope the new administration removes (or at least \"massively increases\") this retarded threshold of $600.\n\nA business should be able to pay people at the very least $10K without having to issue 1099s...\n\nI really don't like this outsourced financial surveillance. Not only is it financial surveillance, but the costs associated with it are put on businesses 🤬",
